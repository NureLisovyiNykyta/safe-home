## Project Overview

Safe Home is designed to enhance home security through a seamless integration of hardware and software. The system monitors door sensors in real-time, providing users with instant notifications and control via a mobile app, while administrators manage the system through a web interface.

### Integrated Services
- **Backend**: A REST API built with Flask, using PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and management.
- **Frontend**: A Single Page Application (SPA) developed with React, served via Nginx, tailored for admin users.
- **Mobile**: An Android application written in Kotlin, designed for end-users to monitor and control their home security.

## Features
- **Real-time Sensor Monitoring**: Instant updates on door open/close events.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports multiple homes and users with a modular design.
- **Secure Authentication**: Protected API endpoints with OAuth and session management.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Web interface for managing sensors, users, and subscriptions.
- **Mobile Access**: User-friendly Android app for remote monitoring and notifications.
- **Subscription Management**: Integration with Stripe for handling payment plans.

## Architecture
The project is structured as a distributed system:
- **Backend**: Flask-based REST API with SQLAlchemy and Flask-Migrate, hosted on Azure App Service.
- **Frontend**: React SPA, bundled with Webpack, served by Nginx, hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.
- **Mobile**: Kotlin-based Android app, distributed via Google Play Store.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- **CI/CD**: Azure Pipelines for automated builds, tests, and deployments.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
