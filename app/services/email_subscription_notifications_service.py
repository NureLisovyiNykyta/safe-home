                Hello {user.name},

                We wanted to inform you that your subscription to {subscription.plan.name} will expire on {subscription.end_date}.
                If you do not renew your subscription, it will be canceled automatically.

                After cancellation:
                - Your subscription will be replaced with a basic one.
                - Homes and sensors will be archived until the subscription is extended.

                To continue enjoying the benefits of your subscription, please renew it before the expiration date.
